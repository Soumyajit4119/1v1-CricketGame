## 🎮 How to Play?  
 **1️⃣ Starting the Game ✨**

 **2️⃣ Game Rules  📜**
- You start as the Batsman 🏏, and the Computer 🤖 is the Bowler.  
- You pick a number from (1, 2, 4, or 6)—this is your target run.  
- The computer randomly picks a number—this is its bowling guess.  
- If your number does NOT match the computer’s guess, you score runs and continue batting.  
- If both you and the computer pick the SAME number, you’re OUT! 😱 Roles switch.  
- The game follows the same logic when the computer bats.    
- The player with the **highest runs** at the end wins the match! 🎉

## 🏆 Winning Conditions  
✔ If you score **50 runs in 20 balls** and get out, the opponent must beat your score **within 20 balls** to win.  
✔ If the opponent **scores less in 20 balls**, no matter if they are out or not, **YOU WIN!** 🏅  
✔ If both players score the same, the match is a **TIE**!
